o	Micro-Architecture
  RTL design and implementation of Cross-Bar switch topology.
  Optimization done using Round Robin Configuration.

o	RTL compiler
  Synthesized behavioral Verilog netlist using cadence RTL compiler.
	Implemented RTL compiler scripts which includes rtl setup and timing files.
	Automated using tcl script.

o	SOC Encounter
  Used during placement and routing stage of the design. 

o	Post Encounter Layout & Netlist Generation
  Imported GDS to virtuoso Layout
  Verilog to Spice netlist generation.

o	Prime time
  Used Primetime Synopsys tool as a gate-level static timing/power analyzer.
  Post synthesis and Post APR timing Verification has been done using PrimeTime
